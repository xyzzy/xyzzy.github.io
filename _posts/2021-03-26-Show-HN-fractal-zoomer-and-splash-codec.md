title: "Show HN: Smile - Fractal zoomer and splash codec"
---

What started as a simple project to explore advanced javascript optimisations turned into something really big.  
It gave deeper insight in how we perceive motion and how our mind, brain and eyes play a role.  
Expanding the possibilities beyond zooming through procedural generated content, I was really interested in applying the knowledge to real-live imagery and motion.

I'm really proud of the results \[0\]: the "zoomer" engine \[1\] including API for custom content, and the "splash" codec \[2\] including an FFmpeg codec implementation.

Enjoy!
